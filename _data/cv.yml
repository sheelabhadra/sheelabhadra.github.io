# - title: Research Areas
#   type: list
#   contents:
#   - My PhD research focuses on developing machine learning methods applied in neuroscience, with the goal of understanding how the brain understands language and controls speech.
#   - I am also passionate about drawing inspiration from the human brain and intuition in order to develop new methods for machine learning (mainly focused on semi-supervised and curriculum learning).
#   - I am also interested in creating AI agents that can understand language and reason, therefore I have also worked on natural language processing with a focus on question answering and problem solving.
